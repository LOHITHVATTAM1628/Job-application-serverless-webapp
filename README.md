## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Applicant Portal

* Users fill in a form and upload their resume.
* Data is sent via API Gateway to a Lambda function.
* Lambda stores the form data in DynamoDB and uploads the resume to S3.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Recruiter Portal

* Recruiters access a secured page to see all applications.
* The portal fetches data from a protected GET API Gateway endpoint.
* Resumes are accessible via secure S3 URLs.

---

## üóÇÔ∏è Configuration

* Update the **API endpoint URLs** in your frontend JavaScript as needed.
* To change the S3 bucket used for resumes, update the `bucketName` variable in your recruiter portal JS code.
* Ensure CORS is properly configured on your API Gateway endpoints for your frontend domain.

---

## üöÄ Deployment

1. **Lambda Functions**

   * Deploy via AWS Console, AWS SAM, or Serverless Framework.
   * Make sure IAM roles allow S3 and DynamoDB access.

2. **Frontend**

   * Upload your static HTML, CSS, and JS files to an S3 bucket with *Static Website Hosting* enabled.

3. **API Gateway**

   * Set up POST and GET endpoints.
   * Enable CORS for your frontend origin.

4. **DynamoDB & S3**

   * Create a DynamoDB table to store applicant data.
   * Create an S3 bucket for storing resumes.

---

## üìå Notes

* IAM permissions must allow Lambda to access S3 and DynamoDB.
* Consider protecting recruiter endpoints with an API key or Cognito.
* For production, use private S3 buckets and pre-signed URLs for secure downloads.
